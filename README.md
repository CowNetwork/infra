**Note:** Always make sure you are in your virtual environment, if not execute `pipenv shell` otherwise all python modules will be missing.

### Initial install

When deploying the infrastructure from scratch, you have to use an SSH key we call `management-key` which functions basically as a bootstrap key. Add other users SSH key using this command:

```
$ ansible-playbook --private-key <management-key> add_ssh_keys_playbook.yaml -e servers=<groups>
```

The management key has to be set on all hcloud servers.

# TODO:
* sub groups in `inventory.py`
